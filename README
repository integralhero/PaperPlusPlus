The main program is currently implemented in programs/util.py.

When running for the first time, open Makefile and uncomment the get-wiki
and process-wiki commands. Run "sudo python setup.py install". This process
can take up to an hour! Remember to comment these lines out again after you're
done or it will try to redownload and process the corpus.

git ignore the .model files, they are over 450Mb each.

After the corpus is downloaded you can run "python programs/util.py". Any time
you make a change to glove/glove.py you have to recompile by running
"sudo python setup.py install". If it hangs after a while, just kill the
program.
